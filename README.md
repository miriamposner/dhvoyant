Analyze 13 years of DH conference abstracts with Voyant

This is a short exploratory activity designed for college students and graduate students as an introduction to text analysis and digital humanities. It could take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on how much time you give the students to explore on their own (more is probably better). In my class, the activity was preceded by a short introductory lecture about DH definitions and history.

Thank you to Silvia E. Guti√©rrez De la Torre for [assembling the corpus](https://zenodo.org/record/1403230) this activity uses.
